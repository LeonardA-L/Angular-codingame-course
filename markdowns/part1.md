# Right is for coding
Although this angular project has a lot of source files I chose to reduce the noise (like the CSS) and only expose the interesting files to the learner (the TS/HTML files).

The learner can modify these files and then run the project in our environnement.

@[Proof of concept Angular]({"layout": "aside", "stubs": ["src/app/todoitem/todoitem.ts", "./src/app/todoitem/todoitem.html","src/app/todolist/todolist.ts", "./src/app/todolist/todolist.html","src/app/stores/todo-store.ts"], "command": "/bin/bash /project/target/run.sh"})

# Left is for learning
This left panel is here to display the actual course content. It's markdown based, and the contributor can explain basically anything and ask the learner to code stuff on the right.

For this example course, the provided sources make a complete Todo App, but the goal for a normal tutorial would be to provide a basis for the learner and instructions on how to code the rest, and the end result would be a complete Todo App.

This course only has one lesson, but we do support making multiple lessons into one course.
