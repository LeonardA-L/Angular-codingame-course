# Angular Todo App Course
On CodinGame

==================

You just downloaded an archive containing all the sources for your Angular project. This project *includes the code you wrote online before pressing _Run My Code_*. It is intended to let you explore the hierarchy of an Angular project and start learning how to develop real projects out of CodinGame.

To run this project you will need:

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install nodejs
sudo apt-get install npm
sudo npm install -g gulp
```

You can then make your way to the folder and launch

```
npm install
gulp serve
```

`npm` will install the dependencies of your project.

`gulp` will package the app and start a local web server where you can view your app.

Have fun on CodinGame!
